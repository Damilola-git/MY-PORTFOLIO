					<p class="desc">As a result of my training in first degree B(agric).
						 I have come to see the importance of making avaliable food product at highest level of quality,as it affects us as humans.
						This has led me to venture into seafood supply having observed over the years that seafoods particularly in my community are not available at good quality.
                        I have ventured into seafood supply especially crayfish at good quality,though still in small quantity.
